# guess-the-number
I believe every python beginner codes this number guessing game at least once. If you aren't aware, just give it a try, I have added instructions at the beginning!
Some unique things that I have put in are-

1) Used random module, to randomize the number to be guessed, so every time you play the game, the number to be guessed is different and random.
2) I have added a feature that lets the user choose the difficulty level of the game. I've used if-else and range function for the same.
3) Once you finish the game, the programme asks you if you want to try again or exit. Used while loop to add this feature.
4) The programme also tells how many attempts are left, I've used simple arithmetic operators for this.
5) I have tried my best to handle errors using try and except block, while loop and if-else conditional statements. I have tried to include as many cases as possible. 

Please give it a try and let me know what you think!
